Launching the Dangerous App from Launcher/Home screen does not work. 

    <permission
        android:name="course.labs.permissions.DANGEROUS_ACTIVITY_PERM"
        android:protectionLevel="dangerous"/>

        <activity
            android:name=".DangerousActivity"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:permission="course.labs.permissions.DANGEROUS_ACTIVITY_PERM" >

By setting the custom permission with the name "course.labs.permissions.DANGEROUS_ACTIVITY_PERM" amd the protection type to "dangerous".
The Dangeous App is being label as a dangerous application. However, by putting this line android:permission="course.labs.permissions.DANGEROUS_ACTIVITY_PERM" >, it prevent us from opening the Dangerous App.
The only way to open the Dangerous App is by going thru PermissionLab App due to <uses-permission android:name="course.labs.permissions.DANGEROUS_ACTIVITY_PERM"/>.
It give permission to open the Dangerous App.
